 FRANCE_FACTIONS_14_TITLE: "Gold Mine Discovered"

 FRANCE_FACTIONS_18_TITLE: "Martin Luther's Smile"
 FRANCE_FACTIONS_18_DESC: "The writings of the Vulgata are being forgotten in $PROVINCENAME$, as the inhabitants there have more and more taken to practicing heretical rites. The news comes as a major setback for the Clergy, which has prided itself on the successes of state-sanctioned Catholicism. We could dispatch officials to immediately restore order to the province, but forcing the locals into a different faith will most likely hurt the economic viability of the province."

 FRANCE_FACTIONS_21_DESC: "A high magistrate affiliated with the Clergy has presented your Majesty with a most exquisite gift: A copy of the Confucian classic 'The Book of Rites' dated to the late Tang dynasty.

 FRANCE_FACTIONS_21_OPTB: "Why are you giving me Chinese books? Change!"
 FRANCE_FACTIONS_22_TITLE: "Records of the Grand Historian"
 FRANCE_FACTIONS_22_DESC: "$MONARCHTITLE$, You have reigned for some time now, and many consider it time to compile another grand edition of the 'Records of the Grand Historian'. The Grand Historian himself is affiliated with the Clergy. Compiling a book detailing the fortunes of France during your reign would cost a fair bit of money, and give prestige to the Clergy, but the benefits might outweigh the costs. Shall we put the historian to work?"

 FRANCE_FACTIONS_22_OPTB: "No!"
 FRANCE_FACTIONS_23_TITLE: "Burning of books"
 FRANCE_FACTIONS_23_DESC: "The Clergy has had enough of the discord and strife that plagues $COUNTRY$. Pointing to the myriad of schools of thought that flourish within the realm it is no wonder, they argue, that we live in troubled times.

 FRANCE_FACTIONS_25_TITLE: "Withdrawing Excess Paper"
 FRANCE_FACTIONS_25_DESC: "There is general consensus within the Imperial Court that the amount of fiduciary media in circulation is a number much too great for the good of the state finances. That money must be recalled in order for inflation to recede from its current level goes without saying, but the question is how much money should be rebought. The Estates have their varying solutions, and your Majesty is free to choose one of them."
 FRANCE_FACTIONS_25_OPTA: "The Noble Solution"
 FRANCE_FACTIONS_25_OPTB: "The Bourgeois Solution"
 FRANCE_FACTIONS_25_OPTC: "The Clerical Solution"
 FRANCE_FACTIONS_26_TITLE: "Court Bickering"
 FRANCE_FACTIONS_26_DESC: "One of your Clergyman has been insulted by a high ranking official from the Nobility. Apparently the men have had a hard time getting along for quite some time, and the insult was probably not entirely unprovoked. Nevertheless the matter has become a pivot point of politics at the court, and it might be wise if The $MONARCHTITLE$ gave some input on the issue."
 FRANCE_FACTIONS_26_OPTA: "The Clergyman needs to stop complaining"
 FRANCE_FACTIONS_26_OPTB: "The Official needs to apologize"
 FRANCE_FACTIONS_26_OPTC: "The $MONARCHTITLE$ needs a vacation"

With her lack of abilities over the political field, she made Concino Concini the marshal of France, although he never fought a battle, which, in turn, dismissed Henri IV's minister, suppressed the Protestantism and, being half-Habsburg herself, abandoned the French anti-Habsburg policy. By her rule, the 'Princes of the blood', descendants of the French Monarch, revolted, where she was forced to convoke the Estates General of 1614 and 1615, the last time the Estates General would ever be called before the French Revolution. During her son's reign, he overturned the pro-Habsburg and pro-Spanish policies, ordered the assassination of Concino Concini and exiled her twice."

During her regency, she saw the continuation of the Franco-Spanish War and the start of the 'Fronde' of the parlament, a civil revolt which, in the end, provided an incentive for the absolutism. Anne is one of the central figures in Alexandre Dumas' novel, The Three Musketeers and its sequels."

A later conspirancy would revive the plan, the Pontcallec Conspirancy, which was a ta revolt. Philippe saw the beggining and the end of the War of the Quadruple Alliance, worsening the spanish relations, which would only be totally restored when Louis XV's son, Louis, which didn't turn into be King of France, as Louis XV outlived him, would be married to Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain, which didn't gave any children, as she died 20 years old.
