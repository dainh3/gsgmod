gsgmod
======

/gsg/mod has been REVAMPED and UPDATED for Conquest of Paradise! A lot of the stuff Paradox added made my colonial stuff partially redundant, but the base concept of the mod as "vanilla-plus" is still here. This mod also integrates several other mods. In all cases permission has been given by the authors. 

Features:

Re-balanced the idea groups. Espionage is now DIP, Naval is now MIL and Aristo/Plutocratic is now ADM. These are partially because the actual benefits these give don't match up to their supposed categories in vanilla, and also because ADM ideas are underpowered compared to the value of ADM points. Also, the actual Administrative idea group has been purged of mercenary ideas and replaced with ones that reduce advisor, adm tech, and idea costs. The merc ideas have been pushed into Quantity, and Quantity itself has been buffed, thus making it an actual viable idea to pick. There are other minor changes to most ideas too, buffing and nerfing where appropriate. 

Quantity and Quality are mutually exclusive, as ar Offensive and Defensive. They ought to be tradeoffs. 

To compensate for these, two new idea groups have been added: Aggressive and Isolationist. The former gives many CBs early, and favors a highly expansionist blobbing strategy. Isolationist is for more vulnerable nations who need all the help they can get against bigger, badder, more advanced powers - think Japan. 

Tenth Idea mod integrated. 

Many new countries added, most are formable by the player: Iceland, Illyria, Celtic Britannia, Celts, Scottish Union, Breton France, Occitania, Iberia, Al-Andalus (for Muslims), Andalucía (for Christians), Lotharingia, Arabia, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Great Tatary, Latvia, Estonia, Teutonia, Rhodes, Carinthia, Latin Empire, Kurdistan, China. 

More cultures: Ashkenazi, Frisian, Icelandic, Cornish, Venetian, Corsican, Sardinian, Tuscan, Piedmontese, Emilian, Neapolitan, Arpitan, Bosnian, Slovene, Schlesian, Szekely, Slovak, Kurdish, Ainu. 

Culture groups: Romanian, Magyar, Lowland. 

More places are colonial regions: Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Indochina, Polynesia, Korea, Japan, China, Eastern Siberia, Arabia, North Africa, Abyssinia, Western Africa, Kongo, Eastern Africa, Somalia, South Africa, India, Manchuria, Fertile Crescent, Egypt. 

All colonies are now [Country Adjective] Colony, rather than [Primary Culture] Colony. Prevents stuff like "Castilian Peru" under Spain. 

Colonial names are un-♥♥♥♥ed - no more "Thirteen Coloniesian" or "Quebecian". 

Peace of Westphalia bookmark. 

Cornwall is pink like in EU3. 

Western European trade node is scrapped and made like how it was before. Also, Canton, Novgorod and Mexico City are end-nodes. 

The trade goods from the New Economy mod are integrated - hemp, cinnamon, lead, glassware and more! 

You can expel the Jews to a new world province and have them form Israel. 

European provinces are better shaped (Historical Map Improvement mod) 

Many new events to do with trade, religion, and diplomacy. 

Integrated France flavor mod, without the factions. 

Empire government isn't restricted to Byzantium. Also, once you get to ADM tech 22 you can reform to a Modern Empire. 

You can choose which side to back in a Civil War.
