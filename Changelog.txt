Added defines changes from 1.5 patch.
Fixed a bunch of bugs from France Flavor mod.
-The DÃ®me event no longer keeps spamming itself when denied.
-Made sure no other event will happen twice, unless when desired.
-(Regent) Anne is now Anne de Beaujeu, to make it different from "Anne (Regent)" (the Habsburg regent).
-Made a couple events so France doesn't lose their current dynasty due to Queen-regents (de Valois losing to de' Medici dynasty, de Bourbon losing to von Habsburg).
