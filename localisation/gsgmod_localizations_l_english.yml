 PEACE_OF_WESTPHALIA_TITLE: "Peace of Westphalia"
 PEACE_OF_WESTPHALIA_DESC: "The Peace of Westphalia was a series of peace treaties signed between May and October 1648 in Osnabrück and Münster which ended the Thirty Years' War in the HRE, and the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) between Spain and the Dutch Republic. With Habsburg and Catholic power curtailed and Germany split into a thousand shards, the Peace signified the beginning of the modern era. The concepts of states with well-defined boundaries and the principle of 'cuius regio, eius religio' - the freedom of a government to decide its state religion - marked this historic transition."

 steppe_musketeer: "Steppe Musketeer"
 steppe_musketeerDESCR: "The continued incursions of European invaders and traders caused Western innovations like muskets to penetrate deep into central Asia. It became a fearsome weapon in the hands of nomad and settlers alike."
 steppe_shock_cavalry: "Steppe Shock Cavalry"
 steppe_shock_cavalryDESCR: "European tactics continued to spread into the steppe by osmosis. Cavalry would fire their muskets at long range to soften up the enemy, then charging, using swords or lances at close range."
 steppe_gallop: "Steppe Gallop Cavalry"
 steppe_gallopDESCR: "As tactics and technology evolved, the nomadic warriors began to use pistols on horseback rather than the cumbersome muskets. They would fire their pistols during the charge itself, doing massive damage to the enemy."

 discover_madagascar_title: "Sail westwards!"
 discover_madagascar_desc: "A thousand years ago, a group of colonists set sail west for a mythical land they called 'Madagascar', and were never heard from again. Now that our shipbuilding technology has advanced to the point where such a journey would not be a one-way trip, we must investigate to see if these lands are in fact real."
 colonize_madagascar_title: "Colonize Madagascar"
 colonize_madagascar_desc: "Alas! We have found the descendants of our ancestors in Madagascar, but in the absence of strong government they have degenerated into savagery and barbarism! We must bring our wayward cousins back into the fold of Malay civilization."
 darien_scheme_title: "The Darien Scheme"
 darien_scheme_desc: "The Darien Scheme was an attempted Scottish colony in Panama, which, if it had paid off, would have allowed Scotland to control the lucrative flow of trade between the Pacific and the Caribbean."
 #reform decisions
 reform_tribal_coin_minting_title: "Reform: Establish a Mint"
 reform_tribal_coin_minting_desc: "Currently, the people of $COUNTRY$ participate in primitive barter trading, with gold and silver coins a rarity. By mandating that taxes may only be paid in the official currency minted by the state, we will not only streamline our tax system, we will also gain a degree of control over the economy."
 standardize_tribal_alphabet_title: "Reform: Standardize the Alphabet"
 standardize_tribal_alphabet_desc: "Introduce an official, standardized writing system and alphabet to make record-keeping more efficient. This will allow written laws to be understood more broadly."
 tribal_official_language_title: "Reform: Declare an Official Language"
 tribal_official_language_desc: "Our country is a mess of different mutually unintelligible dialects. One can't walk over to the next village without hearing the peasants babbling in some savage tongue. We should declare an official language to be used in all laws, and by all state officials."
 permanent_government_hq_title: "Reform: Establish $CAPITAL_CITY$ as Capital City"
 permanent_government_hq_desc: "Though $CAPITAL_CITY$ is one of the most populous and important cities in $COUNTRY$, in truth, the Monarch and his advisors tend to roam around the country to wherever they need to govern. By building a permanent seat of government in $CAPITAL$, it would add tremendous legitimacy to the regime, and allow a professional class of sedentary administrators to thrive."
 establish_civil_service_title: "Reform: Establish a Civil Service"
 establish_civil_service_desc: "By establishing a permanent civil service, the administrators and tax collectors of the realm will have a steady, safe source of income, rather than having to get by through corruption and rent-seeking, at least in theory."
 tribal_trade_regulation_taxes_title: "Reform: Codified Trade Regulation"
 tribal_trade_regulation_taxes_desc: "By writing down a definitive set of laws to do with tolls, harbor fees, taxes and tariffs, we can streamline the trade between our provinces and foreign lands."
 thalassocracy_marketplace_title: "Thalassocracy: Build Port"
 thalassocracy_marketplace_desc: "The first step towards building a maritime trading empire is to construct a large port in a convenient location. If we build it, we can begin to dominate the local seas, and commerce will come our way as merchants seek our protection from piracy."
 thalassocracy_trade_posts_title: "Thalassocracy: Establish Trade Posts"
 thalassocracy_trade_posts_desc: "Not only do we need centralized areas of commerce, we need to establish small trading outposts up and down the coast, and along the major rivers of the hinterlands. This will ensure that our merchants can buy and sell goods in even the most backwater of provinces."
 thalassocracy_standard_title: "Thalassocracy: Adopt Naval Standard"
 thalassocracy_standard_desc: "Adopt an official naval standard that will signify to friend and foe alike who they are dealing with."
 declare_thalassocracy_title: "Declare Thalassocracy"
 declare_thalassocracy_desc: "Abolish our primitive tribal government and focus our ambitions on trade and the navy."
 declare_thalassocracy_tooltip: "Remove all modifiers enabled by §Ytribal reform§! decisions, barring those to do with §Ythalassocratic reform§!."
 cult_build_big_temple_title: "Religious Cult: Construct a Grand Temple"
 cult_build_big_temple_desc: "Our land is a hodgepodge of different local $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ sects. To legitimize the one True Faith, we should erect a giant temple in the centre of $CAPITAL_CITY$. The minor faiths' petty little totem poles will be nothing compared to this grand feat of architecture."
 cult_predict_eclipse_title: "Religious Cult: Predict Solar Eclipse"
 cult_predict_eclipse_desc: "Our astronomer has recently found a way to tell when the gods will blot out the sun. Rather than punishments for insufficient sacrifices, the gods seem to do it on an arcane but apparently predictable schedule. An idea strikes you: declare ahead of time that if you are not obeyed and revered as part of the pantheon, you will eat the sun. Then just kill the feckless old astronomer so the secret does not spread."
 cult_wipe_out_opposing_title: "Religious Cult: Destroy Opposing Traditions"
 cult_wipe_out_opposing_desc: "Despite our best efforts, there are still enclaves of our subjects who follow different religious traditions. Some are so arrogant and hubristic that they don't even sacrifice animals to appease the gods! We need to remove these scourges once and for all."
 declare_cult_title: "Declare Yourself the God-King"
 declare_cult_desc: "Since the eclipse episode, people genuinely believe you to be divine, perhaps even a demi-god. Such lowly titles are an insult to your magnificence! You are the God of gods, the mightiest and all-powerful. There shall be no more sacrifices and offerings to the lesser deities: everyone shall serve the God-King!"
 declare_cult_tooltip: "Remove all modifiers enabled by §Ytribal reform§! decisions, barring those to do with §Yreligious cult reform§!."
 kritarchy_establish_courts_title: "Kritarchy: Establish Court System"
 kritarchy_establish_courts_desc: "Disputes between people of all social strata tended to be resolved through violence, sometimes erupting into endless feuds between rival families. This destroyed lives, property, and most importantly: the tax base. By establishing the state courts as a disinterested third party arbitrator, long-term murderous violence can be curbed, and fines can be collected from the guilty parties."
 kritarchy_promote_elders_title: "Kritarchy: Promote Wise Elders"
 kritarchy_promote_elders_desc: "Every village has its own resident Wise Elder - the kind-yet-stern grandfather archetype who dishes out wisdom and advice to the younger generations. If we were to seek out these elders and employ them in the local judicial apparatus, it would give our court system a friendly face and increase the chances of compliance from the populace."
 kritarchy_overrule_customs_title: "Kritarchy: Overrule Local Customs"
 kritarchy_overrule_customs_desc: "Despite our centralizing efforts, many provincial towns do not follow the official legal code, in favor of local customs. This must stop."
 declare_kritarchy_title: "Declare Kritarchy"
 declare_kritarchy_desc: "The incessant bickering between different tribes is unacceptable. Only an official, written system of law is fit to govern a society, and it is natural that those governors be the most well-versed in these laws. Thus, we declare the Kritarchy: the rule of the judges."
 declare_kritarchy_tooltip: "Remove all modifiers enabled by §Ytribal reform§! decisions, barring those to do with §Ykritarchy reform§!."
 despotism_conquer_nearby_title: "Despotism: Conquer Nearby Weaklings"
 despotism_conquer_nearby_desc: "We are strong, and the neighboring savages are weak. The natural order of things is for us to rule them."
 despotism_conquer_nearby_tooltip: "§Y[Root.GetName] will expand into a nearby uncolonized province and genocide the natives.§!"
 despotism_caste_system_title: "Despotism: Institute Caste System"
 despotism_caste_system_desc: "Though in any society there is a de facto social hierarchy, it is best to formalize it legally so that our subjects truly know their place, and aren't to get any ideas about rising above their station. Hence, we should divide society into distinct castes, with rigidly defined rules for interaction."
 despotism_kill_local_leaders_title: "Despotism: Kill Off Local Challengers"
 despotism_kill_local_leaders_desc: "To make our control over this land absolute, we must kill off the local nobility so that there can be no nuclei around which rebellion might ferment. Rule by the sword, or die by it."
 declare_despotism_title: "Declare Despotism"
 declare_despotism_desc: "Everyone fears us now, and our control over the realm is undisputed. Today, we crown you King of $COUNTRY$."

 feudalism_tie_peasants_title: "Feudalism: Tie Peasants To The Land"
 feudalism_tie_peasants_desc: "Magnify the power of landowners by restricting the movement of peasants. They are legally bound to work the land and serve in the local aristocrat's private army, in exchange for economies of scale and protection from brigands and banditry."
 feudalism_property_as_jurisdiction_title: "Feudalism: Property as Jurisdiction"
 feudalism_property_as_jurisdiction_desc: "The notion that property and jurisdiction were two sides of the same coin was a central principle of European feudalism. The Monarch essentially granted much jurisdiction to lords and corporate bodies (such as the Church), but owned the residual jurisdiction of the realm (i.e. all jurisdiction not owned by someone else). This grant (or charter) was a property deed, which passed through inheritance like any other property. This system formed a kind of 'peer-to-peer' government."
 feudalism_noble_privilege_title: "Feudalism: Noble and Church Privileges"
 feudalism_noble_privilege_desc: "The nobles and the clergy had significant bargaining power at the expense of the titular monarch. Keeping them happy with concessions like a reduced tax burden was part and parcel of managing the patchwork collection of fiefs that was a feudal 'kingdom'."
 declare_feudalism_title: "Declare Feudalism"
 declare_feudalism_desc: "Abolish the remnants of old tribal law and customs, and commit to the reality of a feudal $COUNTRY$. The 'King' is seen as the first among equals to the nobles, and his position is always weak. The realm is balanced on a knife-edge between centralization under the monarch, or power being shared between hostile aristocratic families should the monarch lose his footing."
 declare_feudalism_tooltip: "Remove all modifiers enabled by §Ytribal reform§! decisions, barring those to do with §Yfeudal reform§!."

 khan_of_khans_desc: "The steppes of Asia have been divided among warring nomadic states since the original Mongol empire fractured and disintegrated.

 al_andalus_nation_desc: "We have recovered from the brink of destruction by the hands of the crusading Christians, and now occupy our rightful lands.

 reform_imperial_administration_desc: "Though our Empire is still as grand as ever, under the surface is has begun to ossify.

Now many prominent Rabbis and intellectuals have voiced the idea of a mass Jewish exodus to one of our colonies, in order to build a new homeland. Giving official support would help the project immensely."
 french_nation_b_title: "Form Fransese Nation"
 french_nation_b_desc: "This year will mark the beginning of an evolutionary period for our nation.

 illyrian_nation_title: "Unite the Illyrian Lands"
 illyrian_nation_desc: "The brainchild of a group of Dalmation intellectuals in the 15th century, the Illyrian movement reached its apogee with the advent of the Counter Reformation.

 agg_primitives: "Terra Nullius"
 agg_primitives_desc: "The primitive races we encounter have very little in the way of proper governments as we understand it. Without government there is no law, and without law there is no property, so we hardly need justification to conquer 'their' lands."

 agg_demands: "False Flags"
 agg_demands_desc: "The key to peace deals is how outside powers respond. By showcasing the enemy atrocities (real or fictitious) that gave us no choice but to pre-emptively attack to safeguard our people, our neighbors will be sympathetic when we take an extra province or two in the treaty."
